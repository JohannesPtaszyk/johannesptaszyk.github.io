# Introducing myself

Thank you for visiting my page and probably even reading some of my blog entries. My name is Johannes Ptaszyk and I am from Bottrop, Germany.

I am a Junior Android Software Engeneer at the german cyber security company G DATA Software AG.

Unlike most of the other developers I know writing sosftware is not only a job for me, but a passion.

I also love music and from time to time play the drums, the cajon or even some guitar.
