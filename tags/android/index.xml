      <description>Droidcon this year was the first time I attended a conference. I want to share what it was like and give a small summary on the talks and workshops I&amp;rsquo;ve attended.
I will only summarize the most important take aways of each talk and provide some links with more information. I just want to share what I found interesting and provide some way to get kicked off with a topic. üëè
Summary Community Day The first day of Droidcon was all about getting engaged.</description>
