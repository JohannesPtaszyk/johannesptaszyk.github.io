<p>Droidcon this year was the first time I attended a conference. I want to share what it was like and give a small summary on the talks and workshops I&rsquo;ve attended.</p>

<p>I will only summarize the most important take aways of each talk and provide some links with more information. I just want to share what I found interesting and provide some way to get kicked off with a topic. 👏</p>

<h1 id="summary-community-day">Summary Community Day</h1>

<p>The first day of Droidcon was all about getting engaged. All started with a small introduction to the conference. It was followed by filling the &ldquo;barcamp&rdquo;-slots that were left open for talks that either didn&rsquo;t get accepted or people who wanted to give a talk or do a workshop spontaneously.
There were a lot of people who brought really cool things to the board.</p>

<h2 id="speed-networking">Speed Networking</h2>

<p>After the introduction session finished, I attended at the speed networking.</p>

<p>All people attending had to stand in two parallel lines and face the people on the other line.
As soon as we got a signal, we just moved close to the person on the opposite side and had 30 seconds to introduce us to each other. After the 30 seconds we got another signal and went back to our line. All people on the first line now were supposed to move 2 steps left and the others were supposed to move 1 step right so everyone was facing a different person and the same thing kept repeating.</p>

<p>It was a great idea and really helped me to get in comfortable with talking to others and also resulted in some conversations after the session.</p>

<p>The session was moderated by <a href="https://twitter.com/tamrefrank">Frank Tamre</a> who also hosts <a href="https://droidcon.co.ke/">Droidcon Nairobi</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sketchnote-workshop">Sketchnote workshop</h2>

<p>The second session for me was a sketchnoting workshop.</p>

<p>The key takeaway here was to just keep trying and find a system for layout and shapes that works for you!</p>

<p>It might be nice to have different pens and highlighters, but you should be able to accomplish everything with just one color as well.</p>

<p>To connect thoughts use arrows, to highlight stuff put it inside a box, make it a 3D-object or give it a backdrop shadow.</p>

<p>A really nice on hear was to not draw and write too fast, because it will increase readability and you will automatically write a little bit bigger.</p>

<p>After the session I decided to try this method of taking notes for the rest of the conference and will now share my results with you together with the summaries of all other talks.</p>

<p>Some cool pages to visit regarding sketchnotes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lot of sketchnotes with different topics can be found <a href="https://sketchnoting.dev/">here</a></li>
<li>If you need help finding icons look <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/TeresaHolfed">Teresa Holfeld</a> for this session!</p>

<h2 id="make-your-app-smarter">Make your app smarter</h2>

<p>Huawei is one of the smartphone manufacturers with the highest market share on the planet. They do not only build the smartphones and the software, but even design and produce some of the internal like the cpus. A while ago they started leveraging that to build small processing units in to their devices which are optimized for AI and ML.</p>

<p>To help developers leveraging the power of these components they now provide a full set of tooling and sdks - HiAi.
It includes an Android Studio IDE plugin, with an emulator (Not really an emulator but a remote device) and an sdk with support for a lot of use cases like: object detection, image analysis, background detection and more.</p>

<p>To get started you need to install the plugin and connect to a device (either a real one or the one of the remotes). Then you set up a new Android Studio project and open the plugin. Now you (sadly currently only supported for Java) you can start dragging and dropping use cases in to your code, which already provide all the boilerplate to set everything up.</p>

<p>At this point you can start leveraging the power of the new hardware.</p>

<p>Find more information and get started:</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-matters">Accessibility matters</h2>

<p>Accessibility is an underrated feature. It provides ways for disabled people to get in to your app, and you can provide ways for them to increase productivity and make their lives easier.</p>

<p>But.. It is not only a nice thing to have for people who have disabilities. You also benefit from it!
Imagine you crashed with the bike and broke your forearm and now you only have one hand left to do your stuff, but your phone has a 6&rdquo; screen. Would you rather have all important buttons and interactive views at the top or at the bottom? Would you rather have an app that is prepared to work with voice commands or not?</p>

<p>It is really important to think about how your users will interact with the application. Put the things they need to reach to the bottom. Use Androids accessibility features like: content descriptions, announceForAccessibility() and have the contrast of your colors in mind.</p>

<p>Thinking about and implementing accessibility features should not be a feature on its own, but rather be implemented during all the work you do!</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>

<p>My first day at Droidcon was really exciting! I met a whole bunch of cool people and also learned a lot of things.
I really enjoyed getting in to the community and it impressed me massively what a community can achieve.
Really was looking forward to the second day and more awesome talks.</p>

<p>The Berlin Google Developer Group had a booth at the conference. They invited everyone who wanted to, to join them for 15 minutes and write an app together.
